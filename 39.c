  // We have the perimeter p and sides a, b, c

  // p = a + b + c (1)
  // c = p - a - b
  //
  // And for a right angled triangle we have
  // a^2 + b^2 = c^2   (2)
  //
  // Substituting we get
  // a^2 + b^2 = (p - a - b)^2
  // a^2 + b^2 = p^2 + a^2 + b^2 - 2pa - 2pb + 2ab
  // 2pb - 2ab = p^2 - 2pa
  // 2b(p - a) = p^2 - 2pa
  // b = (p^2 - 2pa) / 2(p - a)
  //
  // Also if a and b is even, from (2) c must also be even. Proof:
  //
  // If n = 2k, then n^2 = 4k^2 = 2(2k^2), which is 2 times an integer and 
  // therefore is even. The sum of two even numbers is even. In (1) that makes
  // c^2 even and therefore c even. (3) The sum of 3 even numbers is even and 
  // P must then be even.
  //
  // If a and b is both odd, 
  // n = 2k + 1
  // n^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1
  // n^2 = 2(2k^2 + 2k) + 1
  // Since m = 2k^2 + 2k is an integer, you have expressed n^2 as 2m+1, 
  // making it odd. The sum of two odd numbers is even.In (1) that makes
  // c^2 even and therefore c even. (4) The sum of 3 even numbers is even and 
  // P must then be even.
  //
  // If only a or b is even and the other odd
  // by (3) and (4) the sum of an odd and even number c^2 must be odd and there
  // for c must be odd. The sum of two odd numbers and one even number is even
  // and P must then be even.
  //
  // We can therefor conclude that we only need to look for even values of p.
